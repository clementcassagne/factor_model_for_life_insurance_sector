# Stone's Two-Index Model: A Relevant Factor Model for Life Insurance Sector in the prolonged period of low interest rates

Models factors are essential tools for asset management. In addition to their usual using, they can be useful in identifying sector- or industry-specific risk factors. The purpose of the brief study (in the ipynb file) is precisely to use them for this purpose, for one of the most important financial sectors, the life insurance industry. Specifically, we examine the effects of interest rate changes on stock returns of European groups engaged in traditional life insurance using the standard OLS model and regularization algorithms for linear regression (LASSO with Cross-Validation, Ridge, Elastic Net). Using Stone's two-index model, the results indicate that the returns of insurers engaged in life insurance business are, for the prolonged period of low interest rates, more sensitive to interest rate changes than their non-life insurers.
